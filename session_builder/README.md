# Audio Synth Functions

This folder contains a small library of Python synthesis routines used by `sound_creator.py` and the accompanying GUI to build entrainment audio tracks.  Each function creates a block of stereo samples from a dictionary of parameters.  Transition versions (ending in `_transition`) sweep parameters from a starting value to an ending value over the step.

## Installation and performance notes

The `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` helpers install dependencies with `NUMBA_CPU_NAME=host` so Numba can emit code tuned for your CPU. You can optionally set `NUMBA_CPU_FEATURES` before running either script if you need to pin the target flags manually.

To confirm Numba is available and using multiple cores, run the lightweight benchmark:

```
python -m binauralbuilder_core.utils.numba_status --benchmark
```

The script prints the detected thread count and throughput so you can verify parallel execution is active.

## Quick Usage

```
from synth_functions.sound_creator import generate_audio, load_track_from_json

data = load_track_from_json("track.json")
generate_audio(data, "output.wav")
```

Track definition files now use a nested structure:

```json
{
  "global": {"sample_rate": 44100, "crossfade_duration": 1.0},
  "progression": [
    {"start": 0, "duration": 8.0, "voices": []}
  ],
  "background_noise": {},
  "overlay_clips": []
}
```

Background noise is only mixed when `background_noise.file_path` references a
`.noise` preset or `background_noise.params` contains the noise generator
settings directly. If both are absent, no noise will be added.

Noise generator settings can be stored separately using `.noise` files. The
saved JSON now captures the complete colour definition under a
``noise_parameters`` object (including the preset name in ``noise_parameters["name"]``)
instead of a lone ``noise_type`` string:

```
from audio import NoiseParams, save_noise_params, load_noise_params

params = NoiseParams()
save_noise_params(params, "my_settings.noise")
loaded = load_noise_params("my_settings.noise")
```

Voice parameters from the GUI can likewise be stored as presets using `.voice` files:

```python
from audio import VoicePreset, save_voice_preset, load_voice_preset

preset = VoicePreset()
save_voice_preset(preset, "my_voice.voice")
loaded_voice = load_voice_preset("my_voice.voice")
```

Audio can also be generated step by step by calling any synth function directly:

```
from synth_functions import rhythmic_waveshaping
samples = rhythmic_waveshaping(duration=10.0, sample_rate=44100, carrierFreq=200)
```

## Available Voices

The table below lists the currently implemented synth functions and the meaning of their most important parameters.  Frequencies are given in hertz and amplitudes generally range from 0.0 to 1.0.

### binaural_beat

| `panFreq` | 0 | Frequency of the pan modulation LFO |

### isochronic_tone
A pulsing tone using a trapezoid envelope.  This voice now accepts the same
set of modulation parameters as **`binaural_beat`** (excluding the glitch
options) while retaining the isochronic-specific envelope controls.

Additional parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `rampPercent` | 0.2 | Portion of each pulse used for fade in/out |

| `panType` | linear | Motion style across the range (`linear`, `inward`, `outward`) |
| `panFreq` | 0 | Frequency of the pan modulation LFO |

The `_transition` variant accepts `start` and `end` forms of each parameter
(`startAmpL`/`endAmpL`, `startAmpR`/`endAmpR`, `startBaseFreq`/`endBaseFreq`, etc.) to smoothly move
between settings over the step.


### rhythmic_waveshaping
A carrier is modulated by an LFO, then passed through a tanh waveshaper.

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `amp` | 0.25 | Overall level of the output |

### noise_generator
Swept-notch coloured-noise voice shared with the standalone noise generator. The
static version produces a constant setting per step, while
`noise_generator_transition` sweeps between start/end values (including stereo
levels) using the same curve controls as other transition voices.

| Parameter | Default | Effect |

| `amp_envelope` | `None` | Optional list of `[time, level]` points for additional amplitude automation. |

The transition variant recognises the same parameters with `start`/`end`
prefixes (for example `start_lfo_freq`, `end_lfo_freq`, `start_amp_left`,
`end_amp_left`) plus `initial_offset`, `duration`, and `curve` to match the
step transition helpers.

### hybrid_qam_monaural_beat
Left channel uses QAM style modulation while the right channel runs a monaural beat.

Important parameters: `ampL`, `ampR`, QAM carrier and AM settings for the left side (`qamCarrierFreqL`, `qamAmFreqL`, `qamAmDepthL`, ...), plus monaural beat controls for the right side (`monoCarrierFreqR`, `monoBeatFreqInChannelR`, AM/FM/phase settings, etc.).

### spatial_angle_modulation

### spatial_angle_modulation_monaural_beat
Combines the monaural beat voice with spatial angle modulation.  Parameters mirror those of `monaural_beat_stereo_amps` along with spatial movement controls (`spatialBeatFreq`, `spatialPhaseOffset`, `pathRadius`, etc.).

### subliminal_encode
Encodes audio files as ultrasonic subliminals. Multiple files may be supplied via `audio_paths` and can either be mixed together (`mode="stack"`) or played one after another (`mode="sequence"`). When sequencing, a one second silence is inserted between each subliminal. The chosen arrangement loops for the duration of the step.

Accessed via the "Add Subliminal" GUI button.

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `audio_path` / `audio_paths` | – | Path(s) to the audio file(s) to encode |
| `mode` | `"sequence"` | Sequential or stacked playback |
| `carrierFreq` | 17500 | Modulation frequency (15000‑20000 Hz) |
| `amp` | 0.5 | Output level |

## Volume Envelopes
Each voice may optionally include a volume envelope definition:

- `linear_fade` – specify `fade_in` and `fade_out` durations in seconds.
- `adsr` – attack, decay, sustain, and release times.
- Leaving the envelope undefined applies a small 10 ms fade to avoid clicks.

## Transition Curves
Transition voices accept a `transition_curve` parameter controlling how values
move from their start settings to the final ones. Supported options are:

- `linear` – constant rate from start to finish (default).
- `logarithmic` – fast start that slows near the end.
- `exponential` – slow start that accelerates toward the end.

Any other string will be evaluated as a Python expression using `alpha` as the
linear ramp from 0 to 1. `numpy` is available via `np` and `math` functions may
be used as well. For example:

```python
transition_curve="np.sin(alpha * np.pi / 2)"
```

If omitted, `linear` is used.

## Tips
- Crossfade between steps to avoid abrupt changes.
- The "binaural beat" voice has a great deal of utility and is the most developed synth function

## Overlay Clips

Additional audio material can be layered on top of the generated voices using
the **Overlay Clips** panel in the editor.  Each clip entry stores the file
path, a start time, amplitude, pan position and optional fade times.  In the
JSON definition these live under the ``overlay_clips`` list. The
duration and finish time columns are populated automatically after a file is
selected.  You can audition a single clip without exporting the entire track by
highlighting it and pressing **Start Clip**; the button changes to **Stop Clip**
while the preview is playing.

## Frequency Tester 
Accessible via the **Frequency Tester** button in the GUI
Allows one to quickly set and check test frequency groups with reduced parameter sets (carrier frequency, beat frequency, amplitude).
