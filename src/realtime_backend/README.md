# Realtime Backend

This crate implements a Rust based audio generation engine capable of real‑time
streaming or offline rendering.  It mirrors the JSON track format used by the
Python implementation and exposes a PyO3 interface for controlling playback.

Also can be used as a standalone CLI executable or as a WASM component for backend use in-browser. 

Implemented components:

- **Project setup** with Cargo, PyO3, CPAL, Symphonia and other DSP dependencies.
- **Track models** matching the Python structures including overlay clips and background noise.
- **Comprehensive voice library** covering all synth functions and their transition variants.
- **Crossfade scheduler** with linear and equal-power curves for smooth step transitions.
- **Audio thread** using CPAL with pausing, seeking and dynamic track updates.
- **Streaming noise and overlay clip support** with block-level normalization to avoid clipping.
- **Optional GPU acceleration** for mixing and crossfades.
- **Python bindings** exposing `start_stream`, `stop_stream`, `pause_stream`, `resume_stream`,
  `start_from`, `update_track`, `enable_gpu`, `push_clip_samples`, `render_sample_wav` and
  `render_full_wav`.
- **WASM-ready build** with ring buffer integration for AudioWorklet use in the browser.
- **CLI tool** to stream or render tracks with configuration file support.

Remaining tasks (see `REALTIME_BACKEND_PLAN.md` for full roadmap):

- Unit tests comparing DSP routines with the Python version.
- Integration with the rest of the application via a high-level Python wrapper.

## Building the Python Extension

To enable the high-performance streaming audio engine in the **Session Builder GUI**, you must build and install this Rust package.

### Prerequisites
1. **Rust Installer**: Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed (get it at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)).
2. **Maturin**: Install the build tool:
   ```bash
   pip install maturin
   ```

### Installation Steps
From the root of the `binauralbuilder` repository:

```bash
cd src/realtime_backend
maturin develop --release
```

This compiles the Rust code and installs it directly into your active Python environment. The `session_builder_window` will automatically detect the `realtime_backend` module and use it for playback.

This produces a `realtime_backend` extension that can be imported from Python:

```python
import realtime_backend

# `track_json` should be a JSON string exported by the GUI
# start playback 30 seconds into the track
realtime_backend.start_stream(track_json, start_time=30.0)

# Render a 60 second sample to a wav file
realtime_backend.render_sample_wav(track_json, "sample.wav")

# Render the entire track to a wav file
realtime_backend.render_full_wav(track_json, "full_output.wav")
```
Call `realtime_backend.pause_stream()` to temporarily silence playback,
`resume_stream()` to continue, `start_from(seconds)` to seek during
playback, and `stop_stream()` to halt playback entirely.

## WebAssembly Build

The backend can also be compiled to WebAssembly for use in the browser.
Install `wasm-pack` and build the crate:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web --release
```

The generated `pkg/` folder contains `realtime_backend.js` and `realtime_backend_bg.wasm`.  See `WASM_GUIDE.md` for integration details.

## Command Line Usage

A command line interface is provided for quickly auditioning or rendering tracks
without Python. Build the project normally and run the `realtime_backend`
binary. Pass the path to a track JSON file and optionally enable full
rendering:

```bash
cargo run --bin realtime_backend -- --path path/to/track.json --start 10.0 --generate false
```

Use the `--gpu` flag to enable GPU acceleration when rendering to a file
(build with `--features gpu`):

```bash
cargo run --bin realtime_backend --features gpu -- --path path/to/track.json --start 10.0 --gpu true
```

GPU acceleration is applied only when `--generate true` is used. Streaming
playback always runs on the CPU. If `--generate true` is supplied, the entire
track is written to the `outputFilename` specified in the JSON. Otherwise it
streams the audio directly to the default output device. While running you can
press `p` to toggle pause/resume, `q` to quit, or hit `Ctrl+C`.

To create a default `config.toml` in the current directory run:

```bash
cargo run --bin realtime_backend -- generate-config --out config.toml
```

This writes the default configuration values so they can be modified as needed.

### CLI `--help` Reference

Running the binary with `--help` lists the available commands and options:

```text
CLI for streaming or rendering a track using the realtime backend
Usage: realtime_backend <COMMAND>

Commands:
  run              Stream or render a track JSON file
  generate-config  Generate a default config file and exit
  help             Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

Each command also has its own help output.

`run` accepts the path to a track JSON file and optional flags:

```text
Usage: realtime_backend run --path <PATH> [--generate <BOOL>] [--gpu <BOOL>] [--start <SECONDS>]

Options:
  --path <PATH>          Path to the track JSON file
  --generate <BOOL>      Generate the full track to the output file instead of streaming [default: false]
  --gpu <BOOL>           Enable GPU accelerated mixing (requires building with `--features gpu`) [default: false]
  --start <SECONDS>      Start playback at the given time in seconds [default: 0]
  -h, --help             Print help
```

`generate-config` produces a default configuration file:

```text
Usage: realtime_backend generate-config [--out <OUT>]

Options:
  --out <OUT>    Output path for the generated configuration [default: config.toml]
  -h, --help     Print help
```

## Optional GPU Acceleration

The backend includes an experimental GPU mixing path behind the `gpu` Cargo
feature. When enabled, compute shaders are used to sum the active voice buffers
for each processed block. Crossfade transitions also leverage the GPU so that
large sessions with many voices can be rendered faster than the Numba powered
Python implementation.

Build the library with GPU support using:

```bash
cargo build --features gpu
```

If the feature is disabled (the default), mixing falls back to a CPU
implementation.
